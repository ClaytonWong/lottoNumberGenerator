Error messages disappear from screen or not shown if 
forbidden combinations of integers are given at required input fields e.g.
numOfGames = 1
sort = false
secondSetNeeded = false
minCountSet1 = 1
maxCountSet1 = 2
numOfRandIntsNeededSet1 = 3

Fixed above problem by changing the form opening and closing tags to div
tags. This is because the lotto number generator is not a form.
