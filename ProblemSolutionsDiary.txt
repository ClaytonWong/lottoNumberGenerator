Fixed above problem by changing the form opening and closing tags to div
tags. This is because the lotto number generator is not a form.

When using spans with rounded borders to hold normal and special numbers,
the single digit numbers are in an ellipse and not a circle. To fix This
problem, I had to use a div instead of a span to hold the normal and 
special numbers.
