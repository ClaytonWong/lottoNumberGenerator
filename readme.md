The creator of Lotto Number Generator recommends the user to take the
following steps to generate numbers for lottery style gambling games.

Step 1:
At the input “How many games do you want to play?”, enter a positive integer. 

Step 2:
If you wish to have your lotto numbers sorted, check the appropriate checkbox.

Step 3:
If your gambling game invokes the use of special numbers, such as a
“Powerball”, then check the appropriate checkbox.

Step 4:
At the input “What is the smallest number you can choose in your game?”,
enter any integer. Usually it’s 1, because this is usually the lowest
number you can choose in most lottery style gambling games.

Step 5:
At the input “What is the largest number you can choose in your game?”,
enter any integer higher than what you have entered at the previous step.

Step 6:
At the input “How many "normal" numbers do you need to choose per game?”,
enter the amount of numbers you need to choose for one game. For example,
if you are playing Ozlotto in Australia, this would be 7.
The number you enter should be greater than zero but smaller than the
number you entered at step 5.

If your gambling game does not use special numbers, skip to step 10.

Step 7:
At the input “What is the smallest special number that you can choose?”,
enter any integer. Usually it’s 1, because this is usually the smallest
special number you can choose in most lottery style gambling games.

Step 8:
At the input “What is the largest special number you can choose?”,
enter any integer higher than what you have entered at the previous step.

Step 9:
At the input “How many special numbers do you need?”, enter an integer
that is greater than zero but smaller than the number you entered at step 8.

Step 10:
Click on the button “Generate lotto numbers”.
If 1 or more error messages appear, try to make corrections at the
corresponding inputs then click on “Generate lotto numbers” again. 
If you wish to clear all inputs and error messages, click on the
“Reset” button.
If you wish to generate new lotto numbers using the same inputs, click
on “Generate lotto numbers” again. 

## Background 
At the moment this project is still a work in progress and only has basic
styling to separate random numbers generated. The intention is to add
clearer error messages and improved styling.
