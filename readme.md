# Lotto Number Generator

## Introduction
This is a personal project that generates random integers that can be used
in the lottery in various countries.

It has the following features:
* Let the user decide the maximum and minimum figures for a pool of numbers.
* Let the user decide how many numbers to draw from the pool.
* Give the user the option to draw at least 1 random integer from a second
  pool of numbers.
* The user can also adjust the maximum and minimum figures for the second
  pool of numbers.
* Let the user adjust the number of sets of random integers to be generated
  for multiple games.
* Give the user the option to sort the random integers generated.

## Background 
At the moment this project is still a work in progress and only has basic
styling to separate random numbers generated. The intention is to add
usage instructions, clearer error messages, and improved styling.
