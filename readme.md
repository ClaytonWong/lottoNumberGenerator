# Lotto Number Generator

## Introduction
This is a personal project that generates random integers that can be used
in the lottery in various countries.

It has the following features:
* Let the user decide the maximum and minimum figures for a pool of numbers.
* Let the user decide how many numbers to draw from the pool.
* Give the user the option to draw at least 1 random integer from a second
  pool of numbers.
* The user can also adjust the maximum and minimum figures for the second
  pool of numbers.
* Let the user adjust the number of sets of random integers to be generated
  for multiple games.
* Give the user the option to sort the random integers generated.

## How to use this code
To get this code to work, you will need Node.js.
You can download it from the official site 

https://nodejs.org/en/

After Node.js is downloaded and installed, and after the project is cloned,
navigate to the directory where the project is cloned using the commandline,
you can run the code by typing 

node randNums.js

## Background 
At the moment this project is still a work in progress and is "backend/commandline
only". My intention is to eventually create a frontend with styling for it using
HTML and CSS.
